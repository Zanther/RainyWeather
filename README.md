# RainyWeather

I created a straightforward weather app using Swift. The app utilizes CLLocation to fetch the device's location, Alamofire to download weather data from OpenWeatherMap.org and follows the MVC design pattern. Additionally, I implemented a singleton to facilitate the downloading and saving of location coordinates.
